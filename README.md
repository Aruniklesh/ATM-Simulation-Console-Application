# ATM-Simulation-Console-Application

The ATM Project is a simple Java-based console application that simulates basic ATM functionalities, allowing users to interact with their bank accounts. Upon entering a valid PIN, users can perform various actions such as checking their balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and printing a receipt of their transactions. The application ensures robust user input handling and error management through extensive use of `try-catch` blocks to handle invalid entries and maintain the flow of the program. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of Java programming, including control flow statements, exception handling, and user input management, providing a practical example of how these concepts are applied in real-world scenarios.
